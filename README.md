# Gesture Recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks
  
American Sign Language (ASL) is a complete, complex language that employs signs made by moving the hands combined with facial expressions and postures of the body. It is the primary language of many North Americans who are deaf and is one of several communication options used by people who are deaf or hard-of-hearing.  

The hand gestures representing English alphabet are shown below. This project focuses on classifying these hand gesture images using convolutional neural networks. Specifically, given an image of a hand showing one of the letters, we want to detect which letter is being represented.
